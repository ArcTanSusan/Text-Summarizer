Ada Lovelace

Throughout her life, Ada was strongly interested in scientific developments and fads of the day, including phrenology[45] and mesmerism.[46] Even after her famous work with Babbage, Ada continued to work on other projects
Ada Lovelace met and corresponded with Charles Babbage on many occasions, including socially and in relation to Babbage's Difference Engine and Analytical Engine
Babbage was impressed by Lovelace's intellect and analytic skills
in short but the Enchantress of Numbers.[51]
Based on this work, Ada is now widely credited with being the first computer programmer[1] and her method is recognised as the world's first computer program.[56] Her work was well received at the time: Michael Faraday would describe himself as a fan of her writing.[57]
This was the first that she knew he was leaving it unsigned, and she wrote back refusing to withdraw the paper
In 12 August 1851, when she was dying of cancer, Ada wrote to him asking him to be her executor, though this letter did not give him the necessary legal authority.
In 1842, Charles Babbage was invited to give a seminar at the University of Turin about his analytical engine
Ada spent the better part of a year doing this
The engine has now been recognized as an early model for a computer and Ada's notes as a description of a computer and software.[59]
It is considered the first algorithm ever specifically tailored for implementation on a computer, and Ada is often cited as the first computer programmer for this reason;[60] however, the engine has never been completed, so her code never tested.
In her notes, Lovelace emphasized the difference between the Analytical Engine and previous calculating machines, particularly its ability to be programmed to solve problems of any complexity.[61] Lovelace realized that the potential of the device extended far beyond mere number crunching
This analysis was a conceptual leap from previous ideas about the capabilities of computing devices, and foreshadowed the capabilities and implications of the modern computer
Ada Byron was the daughter of a brief marriage between the Romantic poet Lord Byron and Anne Isabelle Milbanke, who separated from Byron just a month after Ada was born
Lady Byron wished her daughter to be unlike her poetical father, and she saw to it that Ada received tutoring in mathematics and music, as disciplines to counter dangerous poetic tendencies
Lady Byron and Ada moved in an elite London society, one in which gentlemen not members of the clergy or occupied with politics or the affairs of a regiment were quite likely to spend their time and fortunes pursuing botany, geology, or astronomy
Ada met Babbage in 1833, when she was just 17, and they began a voluminous correspondence on the topics of mathematics, logic, and ultimately all subjects.
In 1835, Ada married William King, ten years her senior, and when King inherited a noble title in 1838, they became the Earl and Countess of Lovelace
Babbage enlisted Ada as translator for the memoir, and during a nine-month period in 1842-43, she worked feverishly on the article and a set of Notes she appended to it
Ada called herself "an Analyst (& Metaphysician)," and the combination was put to use in the Notes
Ada died of cancer in 1852, at the age of 37, and was buried beside the father she never knew
Ada Lovelace (1815-1852) was born Augusta Ada Byron, the only legitimate child of Annabella Milbanke and the poet Lord Byron
Ada met Babbage at a party in 1833 when she was seventeen and was entranced when Babbage demonstrated the small working section of the Engine to her
The Notes included the first published description of a stepwise sequence of operations for solving certain mathematical problems and Ada is often referred to as 'the first programmer'
Ada was the first to explicitly articulate this notion and in this she appears to have seen further than Babbage
Ada Byron, Lady Lovelace, was one of the most picturesque characters in computer history
At the age of 17 Ada was introduced to Mary Somerville, a remarkable woman who translated LaPlace's works into English, and whose texts were used at Cambridge
Babbage worked on plans for this new engine and reported on the developments at a seminar in Turin, Italy in the autumn of 1841
Ada suggested to Babbage writing a plan for how the engine might calculate Bernoulli numbers
After she wrote the description of Babbage's Analytical Engine her life was plagued with illnesses, and her social life, in addition to Charles Babbage, included Sir David Brewster (the originator of the kaleidoscope), Charles Wheatstone, Charles Dickens and Michael Faraday
